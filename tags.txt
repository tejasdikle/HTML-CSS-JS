       <head>
             <title>---------</title>
       </head>
       <body>
            ----------
            ----------

HTML Elements/Tags
An element consists of three basic parts: 
1. Opening tag
2. Element's content
3. Closing tag.

Essential HTML Tags
There are four sets of HTML tags that form the basic structure needed for every HTML file:

1 <html></html>
2 <head></head>
3 <title></title>
4 <body></body>

Definition - <html> </html>
This basically defines the document as web page. All other tags must fall between the html tags.

Header - <head> </head>
The header contains information about the document that will not appear on the actual page, such as the title of the document.

Title - <title> </title>
The title tag defines the title that will appear in the title bar of your web browser. The title must appear between the head tags.

Body - <body> </body>
The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. All your images, links and plain text must go between the <body> and </body> tags.

HTML Tags
HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

Syntax:
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

NOTE: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
